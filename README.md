# Word Per Minute!
 This program lets you flash a paragraph, word by word; in full screen!

In simple words -

User has given a paragraph.

In a black background, I have to show them word by word, the whole paragraph.

What it will do is, it will display -

first word <some delay, first word invisible>

second word <some delay, second word invisible>

So on...
